This is a collection of spam e-mails came from our postmaster and individuals who had filed spam. 
Collection of non-spam e-mails came from filed work and personal e-mails, and hence the word 'george' and the area code '650' are indicators of non-spam. 
These are useful when constructing a personalized spam filter. 
One would either have to blind such non-spam indicators or get a very wide collection of non-spam to generate a general purpose spam filter.
